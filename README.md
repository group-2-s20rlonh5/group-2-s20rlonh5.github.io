## 🎨Design
We took it from wireframe design to final presentation in a week. We collaborated on Mockups to create the wireframes.

## ⏳Difficulties we met & Unmet goals
There were some difficulties we've met and a few things we didn't do as due to time constraints. These included:
- [ ] Implementing a unified style by combining Bootstrap with plain HTML/CSS
- [ ] Naming of the files
- [ ] Testing


## 📙Key takeaways
- We picked up quickly how to collaborate on Github in a limited amount of time
- Wireframing with teammates
- Scheduling meetings and distributing the workload
- Incorporate Javascript to make pages interactive on submit
- Animation effect with Javascript
